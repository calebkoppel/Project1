For this project I took an input file (of format .txt), and went through the list of dates in YYYYMMDD format. 
In the input file, the dates could either be separated by a comma on the same line, each on a new line, or both. 
I created a Graphical User Interface that had two side panels, outputting the list as it came in one side, 
and sorting the dates in chronological order on the other side.
